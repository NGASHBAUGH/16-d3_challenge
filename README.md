# D3 Challenge - Data Journalism and D3 Plot.ly 

In this repository I used D3 in JavaScript to create a scatter plot where each dot represents each state in the United States of America. When the user hovers over each dot a pop up gives more information based on that state. Also, each dot has the state abbreviations on it, below is a screenshot of the scatter plot. 

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Make sure you are in the folder with the "index.html" file in it.
