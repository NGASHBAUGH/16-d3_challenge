          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>
            There is a corrilation 
          </p>
          There seems to be a correlation between high poverty and a lack in healthcare. As seen on the 
          graph above the dots are grouped in an upward fashion from low lack of healthcare and low poverty 
          to high poverty and high lack of poverty. The trend would track logically because most people who live 
          in poverty would tend to not have the money for healthcare. 
          <p>

          </p>
          It is interesting to see that the outliers like Massachusetts have a very low lack of healthcare per individuals in poverty compared to the rest of the states. Also looking at Texas they have a medium poverty rate but a high lack of healthcare, I am not sure what would cause Texas to be such an outlier but it would be interesting to see what the causes of it are.
